# Heart Attack Prediction

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains numeric medical attributes related to heart health. The data was collected from multiple medical institutions and includes features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical measurements.

## Machine Learning Problem
This project addresses a supervised machine learning classification problem. The objective is to predict whether a person has heart disease based on their medical attributes. The dataset includes a target variable that indicates the presence or absence of heart disease, which the model learns to classify.
